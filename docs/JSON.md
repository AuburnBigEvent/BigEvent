JSON
=======
[JSON][json] or the JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange
format. It's meant to be easily read by humans, easily parsed by machines, and
based on a subset of the literal object and array notations in the JavaScript
programming language.

JSON documents can contain contain structures of two types:

 - Collections of name/value pairs. These are called *objects*, but might be
   called an associative array, a mapping, a dictionary, etc in other languages.

 - An ordered list of values. These are called *arrays* and can be thought of
   as arrays in the traditional programming sense. They are like JavaScript
   arrays however, which have no problem storing entries of different types.

Both of these can be nested within one another and within themselves. 

The  name/value pairs within the objects have a syntax of a string within double
quotes `"` followed by a colon `:` followed by a value. Arrays have a syntax of
brackets `[]` surrounding values separated by commas`.

Values may be one of six types:

 1. Nested Object
 2. Nested Array
 3. String Literal ("hello", "dave", etc.)
 4. Number Literal (1, 2.34, 0, etc.)
 5. Boolean Literal (true, false)
 6. null

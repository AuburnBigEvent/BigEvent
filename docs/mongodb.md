Getting Started With MongoDB
============================

We are using [MongoDB][mongodb] for our backend database. MongoDB is an open
source project written in C++ and is the leading NoSQL document database
management system. It's based on JSON and its
[native driver][mongodb-native-driver] is written for Node.JS. There is great
[documentation][mongodb-docs] available and there are lots of examples of it
being used in other Node projects so it's a good fit for our project.

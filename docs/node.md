Getting Started With Node
=========================

Node.JS is essentially a module system and a set of modules written in
JavaScript on top of the V8 JavaScript Engine used in Chrome. The V8
JavaScript Engine is a high performance virtual machine written in C++.

Node.JS is an implementation of the CommonJS Modules Specification. Unlike when
programming in JavaScript for browser based client side development, your
scripts are not linked by a common global scope. Instead, your script can
export public data/functions as a module which can be imported in other 
scripts/modules via a call to Node's `require` function.
